Copying files from http://lingo.stanford.edu/vso/ to see if we can use it to improve our PWN verbs.

Overview 

The Verb Semantics Ontology project is being initiated by Stanford's CSLI and VivoMind Research LLC based on the generous 
granting of IBM's original Verb Ontology project to the public domain via Stanford University's CSLI. 
There are already several other verb ontologies being assembled at various institutions around the world: so why do we need yet another?   

The answer is the effort is/will be a complementary resource to other knowledge representations for verbs;

Secondly, the focus is on connecting the representation to programming languages (Prolog), to new standards, in particular, 
the ISO Common Logic (ISO 24707) standard; and,

Thirdly, and in the longer term, we would like to develop alternative verb semantic ontology representations.   Suggestions are welcome.

GOALS OF THE VERB SEMANTIC ONTOLOGY:

The key goal is to build a Verb Ontology in connection to other works. This will require looking at ontology interoperability. 
Another, no lesser goal, is to connect the Verb Ontology to alternative and novel representations.

We hope to encourage and connect this effort to a variety of other efforts.  
Examples of people, organizations and institutions that engaged in other efforts are:   
Beth Levin and John F. Sowa,  Bonnie J. Dorr (Lexical Conceptual Structure),  Martha Palmer (VerbNet), 
Timothy Chklovski (VerbOcean ), and, Charles Fillmore ( FrameNet ).  
A resources page of links will be provided.

CURRENT DOWNLOAD:

1) The original (MS Access) data set of the IBM Verb Ontology the overview  of the project 
(conducted under the aegis of CSLI's LinGO Lab) and an RTF file: VerbList

2) The preliminary conversion of the data set to (a) CSV files (b) Prolog language files

3) Levin verb classes in the Prolog language (this is a pointer to a page for download)

4) Roget In Prolog with an ontology  in the Prolog language

5) *NEW* Verb Ocean In Prolog split into  various categories the Prolog language

6) *NEW* A Utility dictionary of Verbs in Prolog handling tensed verbs  in the Prolog language

DOCUMENTATION
I have been requested for additional documentation as well as, in particular, examples of use or source 
code to use the resources since the prolog files have just been provided as is. 
To that end I expect to update this site with documentation and sample code sometime in MAY 2011 this year.
